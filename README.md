# Generative AI : 
Generative AI, sometimes called gen AI, is artificial intelligence (AI) that can create 
original content such as text, images, video, audio or software code in response to a 
user’s prompt or request. 
Generative AI relies on sophisticated machine learning models called deep learning 
models algorithms that simulate the learning and decision-making processes of the 
human brain. These models work by identifying and encoding the patterns and 
relationships in huge amounts of data, and then using that information to understand 
users' natural language requests or questions and respond with relevant new content. 
AI has been a hot technology topic for the past decade, but generative AI, and 
specifically the arrival of ChatGPT in 2022, has thrust AI into worldwide headlines and 
launched an unprecedented surge of AI innovation and adoption. Generative AI offers 
enormous productivity benefits for individuals and organizations, and while it also 
presents very real challenges and risks, businesses are forging ahead, exploring how the 
technology can improve their internal workflows and enrich their products and services. 
According to research by the management consulting firm McKinsey, one third of 
organizations are already using generative AI regularly in at least one business 
function.Industry analyst Gartner projects more than 80% of organizations will have 
deployed generative AI applications or used generative AI application programming 
interfaces (APIs) by 2026. 
# How generative AI works: 
For the most part, generative AI operates in three phases:  
Training, to create a foundation model that can serve as the basis of multiple gen AI 
applications. 
Tuning, to tailor the foundation model to a specific gen AI application. 
Generation, evaluation and retuning, to assess the gen AI application's output and 
continually improve its quality and accuracy. 
# Training- 
Generative AI begins with a foundation model—a deep learning model that serves as the 
basis for multiple different types of generative AI applications. The most common 
foundation models today are large language models (LLMs), created for text generation 
applications, but there are also foundation models for image generation, video 
generation, and sound and music generation—as well as multimodal foundation models 
that can support several kinds content generation. 
This training process is compute-intensive, time-consuming and expensive: it requires 
thousands of clustered graphics processing units (GPUs) and weeks of processing, all of 
which costs millions of dollars. Open-source foundation model projects, such as Meta's 
Llama-2, enable gen AI developers to avoid this step and its costs. 
# Tuning- 
Metaphorically speaking, a foundation model is a generalist: It knows a lot about a lot of 
types of content, but often can’t generate specific types of output with desired accuracy 
or fidelity. For that, the model must be tuned to a specific content generation task. This 
can be done in a variety of ways. 
# Fine tuning- 
Fine tuning involves feeding the model labeled data specific to the content generation 
application—questions or prompts the application is likely to receive, and corresponding 
correct answers in the desired format. For example, if a development team is trying to 
create a customer service chatbot, it would create hundreds or thousands of documents 
containing labeled customers service questions and correct answers, and then feed 
those documents to the model.

# What generative AI can create? 
# Text - 
Generative models. especially those based on transformers, can generate coherent, 
contextually relevant text everything from instructions and documentation to brochures, 
emails, web site copy, blogs, articles, reports, papers, and even creative writing.  
# Images and video - 
Image generation such as DALL-E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion can create realistic 
images or original art, and can perform style transfer, image-to-image translation and 
other image editing or image enhancement tasks. 
# Sound, speech and music - 
Generative models can synthesize natural-sounding speech and audio content for 
voice-enabled AI chatbots and digital assistants, audiobook narration and other 
applications. 
# Software code - 
Gen AI can generate original code, autocomplete code snippets, translate between 
programming languages and summarize code functionality. 
# Design and art - 
Generative AI models can generate unique works of art and design, or assist in graphic 
design.  
# Simulations and synthetic data - 
Generative AI models can be trained to generate synthetic data, or synthetic structures 
based on real or synthetic data.  
# Benefits of generative AI: 
# Enhanced creativity - 
Gen AI tools can inspire creativity through automated brainstorming—generating 
multiple novel versions of content. These variations can also serve as starting points or 
references that help writers, artists, designers and other creators plow through creative 
blocks. 
# Improved (and faster) decision-making - 
Generative AI excels at analyzing large datasets, identifying patterns and extracting 
meaningful insights—and then generating hypotheses and recommendations based on 
those insights to support executives, analysts, researchers and other professionals in 
making smarter, data-driven decisions. 
# Use cases for generative AI: 
# Customer experience - 
Marketing organizations can save time and amp up their content production by using 
gen AI tools to draft copy for blogs, web pages, collateral, emails and more. But 
generative AI solutions can also produce highly personalized marketing copy and visuals 
in real time based on when, where and to whom the ad is delivered.  
# Software development and application modernization - 
Code generation tools can automate and accelerate the process of writing new code.  
# Science, engineering and research - 
Generative AI models can help scientists and engineers propose novel solutions to 
complex problems.  
# Challenges, limitations and risks: 
# ‘Hallucinations’ and other inaccurate outputs:
An AI hallucination is a generative AI 
output that is nonsensical or altogether inaccurate but, all too often, seems entirely 
plausible.  
# Inconsistent outputs:
Due to the variational or probabilistic nature of gen AI models, the 
same inputs can result in slightly or significantly different outputs. This can be 
undesirable in certain applications, such as customer service chatbots, where consistent 
outputs are expected or desired.  
# Threats to security, privacy and intellectual property:
Generative AI models can be 
exploited to generate convincing phishing emails, fake identities or other malicious 
content that can fool users into taking actions that compromise security and data 
privacy.  
# Deepfakes:
Deepfakes are AI-generated or AI-manipulated images, video or audio 
created to convince people that they’re seeing, watching or hearing someone do or say 
something they never did or said.  
# Large language models: 
Large language models (LLMs) are a category of foundation models trained on immense 
amounts of data making them capable of understanding and generating natural 
language and other types of content to perform a wide range of tasks. 
LLMs are a class of foundation models, which are trained on enormous amounts of data 
to provide the foundational capabilities needed to drive multiple use cases and 
applications, as well as resolve a multitude of tasks. This is in stark contrast to the idea of 
building and training domain specific models for each of these use cases individually, 
which is prohibitive under many criteria (most importantly cost and infrastructure), 
stifles synergies and can even lead to inferior performance. 
# How large language models work: 
LLMs operate by leveraging deep learning techniques and vast amounts of textual data. 
These models are typically based on a transformer architecture, like the generative 
pre-trained transformer, which excels at handling sequential data like text input. LLMs 
consist of multiple layers of neural networks, each with parameters that can be 
fine-tuned during training, which are enhanced further by a numerous layer known as 
the attention mechanism, which dials in on specific parts of data sets. 
During the training process, these models learn to predict the next word in a sentence 
based on the context provided by the preceding words. The model does this through 
attributing a probability score to the recurrence of words that have been tokenized— 
broken down into smaller sequences of characters. These tokens are then transformed 
into embeddings, which are numeric representations of this context. 
Model performance can also be increased through prompt engineering, prompt-tuning, 
fine-tuning and other tactics like reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to 
remove the biases, hateful speech and factually incorrect answers known as 
“hallucinations” that are often unwanted byproducts of training on so much 
unstructured data. This is one of the most important aspects of ensuring 
enterprise-grade LLMs are ready for use and do not expose organizations to unwanted 
liability, or cause damage to their reputation.  
# LLM use cases : 
LLMs are redefining an increasing number of business processes and have proven their 
versatility across a myriad of use cases and tasks in various industries. They augment 
conversational AI in chatbots and virtual assistants (like IBM watsonx Assistant and 
Google’s BARD) to enhance the interactions that underpin excellence in customer care, 
providing context-aware responses that mimic interactions with human agents. 
LLMs also excel in content generation, automating content creation for blog articles, 
marketing or sales materials and other writing tasks. In research and academia, they aid 
in summarizing and extracting information from vast datasets, accelerating knowledge 
discovery. LLMs also play a vital role in language translation, breaking down language 
barriers by providing accurate and contextually relevant translations. They can even be 
used to write code, or “translate” between programming languages. 
# LLMs benefit organizations: 
Text generation: language generation abilities, such as writing emails, blog posts or 
other mid-to-long form content in response to prompts that can be refined and polished. 
An excellent example is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).  
Content summarization: summarize long articles, news stories, research reports, 
corporate documentation and even customer history into thorough texts tailored in 
length to the output format. 
# AI assistants: 
chatbots that answer customer queries, perform backend tasks and 
provide detailed information in natural language as a part of an integrated, self-serve 
customer care solution.  
# Code generation: 
assists developers in building applications, finding errors in code and 
uncovering security issues in multiple programming languages, even “translating” 
between them. 
# Sentiment analysis: 
analyze text to determine the customer’s tone in order understand 
customer feedback at scale and aid in brand reputation management.  
Language translation: provides wider coverage to organizations across languages and 
geographies with fluent translations and multilingual capabilities.

# LLMs and governance: 
Organizations need a solid foundation in governance practices to harness the potential 
of AI models to revolutionize the way they do business. This means providing access to 
AI tools and technology that is trustworthy, transparent, responsible and secure. AI 
governance and traceability are also fundamental aspects of the solutions IBM brings to 
its customers, so that activities that involve AI are managed and monitored to allow for 
tracing origins, data and models in a way that is always auditable and accountable. 
# Challenges, limitations and risks: 
LLMs Have Computational Constraints-One of the significant limitations of large 
language models is their computational constraints. These models are limited by a fixed 
number of tokens they can process simultaneously, which is essential for maintaining 
efficient performance and timely responses. 
LLM Hallucinations and Inaccuracies-Large language models are prone to hallucinations, 
where they generate misleading or inaccurate text. These hallucinations occur for 
several reasons, primarily related to the training data to which these models are 
exposed. 
Struggles with Complex Reasoning-Large language models also struggle with complex 
reasoning tasks that require understanding beyond literal meanings. These tasks often 
necessitate multi-step problem-solving and nuanced interpretation, which LLMs find 
challenging. 
Difficulty with Linguistic Elements-One of the significant challenges in natural language 
processing is managing the complexities of human language. Large language models 
often struggle with linguistic elements such as idioms, colloquialisms, and figurative 
language.
